        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p>The main goals of this project were to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Get familiar with <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a></li>
            <li>Get familiar with <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/index.html">pandas</a></li>
            <li>Get familiar with <a href="https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/api/index.html">matplotlib</a></li>
            <li>Get familiar with some basic data wrangling issues</li>
            <li>Implement a machine learning model other than a neural network</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Visualization</h3>
        <p>Using matplotlib, and following the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS70iptz-XU"> Predicting Titanic Survivors with Machine Learning</a>
        conference on YouTube, I was able to get some insight in the provided training data. A few plots below show most of these insights.</p>

        <h3>Prediction</h3>
        <p>Starting from the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial"> titanic tutorial</a> we start with a RandomForestClassifier. The first thing I did was clean up some of the data (get rid of NaN values) and add columns such as "FamilySize" and "Child".
        Adding these slightly improves the accuracy of the classifier, but not by much yet. Using a support vector machine allows a bit more of an improvement, but I still have to play around with different kernels to see what works best on this problem.
        The main thing I learned in this project is the importance of data wrangling and feature engineering. As far as I know now, Machine Learning is not just apply multiple algorithms to a dataset and seeing which one works best. Rather, you need to have
        some understanding of the problem in order to solve the problem. Basically, you still need to think about the problem. A couple more things that I can try: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>distribute the missing cabin values according to their distribution per passenger class (instead of using the median value per class)</li>
            <li>add a column "FamilySurvived" (equal to 1 if a family has at least (2 or) 3 surviving members)</li>
            <li>add a column "AtLeastOneSurvived" (equal to 1 if at least 1 member of the family survived)</li>
            <li>do some hyperparameter tuning on RandomForests</li>
        </ul>
